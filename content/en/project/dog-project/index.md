This project uses deep learning models to classify  dog breeds. The [Report](https://henry32144.github.io/udacity-mlnd-dog-project/report.html) was the Udacity MLND homework I finished in 2018. [Improved](https://henry32144.github.io/udacity-mlnd-dog-project/report_v2.html) contains the modification I did to improve the accuracy of the model. [MobileNet](https://henry32144.github.io/udacity-mlnd-dog-project/report_mobilenet.html) is mainly based on Improved, but change the Xception model to MobileNetV2, which is better for application.
